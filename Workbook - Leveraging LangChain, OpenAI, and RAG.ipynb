    "   ```python\n",
    "   urls = [\"https://www.decisionsciences.blog\", \n",
    "           \"https://decisionsciences.blog/2025/02/10/solving-the-last-mile-problem-in-analytics-introducing-the-decision-science-pre-analysis-framework/\",\n",
    "           ...]  \n",

    "   documents = loader.load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Document Splitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the documents, I split them into smaller, manageable chunks using **LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`**. This step is crucial for efficiently processing large documents and making them suitable for embedding and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)\n",
    "docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_size=1000`: This defines the maximum size of each document chunk.\n",
    "- `chunk_overlap=100`: This defines how many tokens should overlap between chunks to preserve context across splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Embedding Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the text into machine-readable format, I used **OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002** model to generate **embeddings**. These embeddings represent the documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space, which are then used for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\")\n",
    "vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embeddings, persist_directory=\"./chroma_db\")\n",

    "- **Chroma**: This vector store handles the storage of embeddings and ensures they are indexed for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Setting Up Retrieval Chain**\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used **LangChain's `RetrievalQA`** to set up a chain that allows the model to query the vector database. This helps with retrieving relevant document sections based on a query, enabling the system to provide intelligent answers based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(\n",
    "    llm=ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"),\n",
    "    chain_type=\"stuff\",\n",
    "    retriever=vector_db.as_retriever()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`RetrievalQA`**: This allows the query to interact with both the language model and the vector store, retrieving the most relevant document chunks.\n",
    "- **`ChatOpenAI`**: A wrapper for OpenAI’s chat models, providing a conversational approach to querying and answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Querying the System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the retrieval chain is set up, I was able to send queries to the system, which would then retrieve relevant documents and use the language model to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query = \"How does Monte Carlo simulation apply to decision sciences?\"\n",
    "result = qa_chain.run(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows me to query the vector database and retrieve context-specific responses, which help answer questions related to decision sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 6: Handling Missing Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, when a query relates to information not found in the loaded documents, the system may respond indicating that no information is available. This ensures that the model doesn’t provide false or unsupported claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "query = \"What are impact paths in decision sciences?\"\n",
    "result = qa_chain.run(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, if the term \"impact paths\" is not found in the documents, the model might indicate that it cannot provide an answer based on the available data. This is important for maintaining accurate and trustworthy responses.\n",

They are established by Decision Scientists to ensure that insights lead to action. An impact path answers critical questions such as what decision an insight informs and why it matters, how the insight aligns with business goals and priorities, what actions should follow from the insight, who is responsible for these actions, and what the anticipated impact of the actions is and how it will be measured. Without these clear pathways, even compelling insights risk being ignored, misunderstood, or deprioritized.\n"

      "Monte Carlo simulations could enhance impact paths in decision sciences by providing more detailed and probabilistic understanding of potential outcomes. Impact paths refer to the chain of events that lead from a decision to its final outcome. Traditionally, these paths are often evaluated based on static point forecasts or best guesses. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Monte Carlo simulations allow for a more dynamic and comprehensive assessment. By running thousands, or even millions, of simulations, we can gain insight into a wide range of possible scenarios and their associated probabilities. This allows decision-makers to better understand the full spectrum of potential impacts, rather than just a single expected outcome.\n",

It allows leaders to prepare for a variety of scenarios and to optimize strategies accordingly, thus making more confident and informed decisions.\n",

      "Lastly, Monte Carlo simulations can also help in identifying and mitigating risks along the impact paths. By visualizing potential outcomes, decision-makers can proactively manage risks and seize opportunities, turning uncertainty into an advantage.

This dataset contains a wide variety of company sizes, however, ranging from very small companies (minimal 50 employees) to very large ones (maximum 5000).
